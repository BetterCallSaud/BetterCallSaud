### This banner gives you a subtle idea about what I am into.
Ipso facto, I am interested in **anything that concerns the human race**.

# Jack of all trades, master of none.
## Tech stack
+ Python üêç
+ ReactJS ‚öõ
+ Solidity üí†
+ A little bit of everything. Really...

## Soft skills
+ I am not applying for a job dammit! Doesn't everything "I have typed into this fah-king markdown file" tell you about me?
+ Also I am an entrepreneur with access to an awesome team and an evil mind! Imagine what **I CAN DO**! *(sinister laugh echoes)*
+ Again, please check my LinkedIn profile to get a better idea of me. I exhibit myself more on LinkedIn than on Twitter hehe.

## Projects
Check my Github profile and you can browse through my repositories.

_**Ending this on a good note. May the Force be with you!**_
